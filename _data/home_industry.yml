    summary: "Worked on LLM-based Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) for HONOR 400 / Magic V5, improving how large language models surface HONOR content in web search."
    bullets:
      - "Built GEO strategy and an experimentation platform by modeling LLM web search as a two-stage 'candidate recall + re-ranking' pipeline, using BM25 and semantic similarity features to analyze what drives LLM citation and recommendation of HONOR content."
      - "Proposed and implemented a Multi-Agent Consistency Controller where a generation agent writes marketing copy and a review agent automatically detects factual errors and exaggerations and returns structured feedback, significantly reducing hallucinations and compliance risks while keeping copy consistent with brand tone."
      - "Designed a GAN-like three-stage pipeline (generation – adversarial evaluation – prior scoring): auto-generated large-scale copy, queried LLMs via headless browsers to track Top-10 citations / Top-50 candidate references, and LoRA-fine-tuned DeepSeek-8B as an 'LLM citation probability' scorer (offline AUC≈0.88, Top-5 hit rate 80%+, Spearman≈0.7 with real online exposure)."
      - "Iterated generation and selection strategies under unified prior/posterior metrics, tripling LLM recommendation rates on core queries (~20%→70%+), keeping overall visibility above 65%, compressing weekly volume from ~100 articles to 5–6, and saving roughly 4M RMB per year in marketing cost."

    role: "Algorithm Intern"
    location: "Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"
    summary: "Developed communication-protocol tooling and automation for in-vehicle Ethernet gateways."
    bullets:
      - "Integrated RTP/RTCP/RTSP protocol stacks in Python to drive automated end-to-end video-stream tests for in-vehicle cameras, covering all packet types and common edge cases."
      - "Designed a regression test harness for a custom lightweight Google Protocol Buffers implementation on MCUs; located a subtle float-rounding mismatch between C++ and Python (round-half-up vs banker’s rounding) that only appeared when the 5th decimal digit was 2/3 and the 6th was 5, and fixed it, raising decoding accuracy from 98.4% to 100%."
      - "Built an Excel-driven gateway configuration compiler: formalised 7 mapping rules that cover all current configuration scenarios, and automatically generated C++ parsing/packing code plus unit tests from spreadsheets, reducing manual coding and review work by roughly 90%."
      - "Re-implemented a recent multi-modal Transformer model for autonomous driving from paper only (no official code), exported it to ONNX, and rewrote several unsupported operators (a custom multi-head attention variant, temporal fusion block, etc.) so that it could run in the internal inference engine, reducing per-frame inference latency by about 35% and peak memory by 25% on the target platform."

    role: "Algorithm Intern"
    location: "Changzhou, Jiangsu, China"
    summary: "Built classical ML credit-risk prototypes and structured data pipelines for retail-loan decision support."
    bullets:
      - "Consolidated multi-source customer tables (demographics, transactions, credit history) into a cleaned, de-duplicated feature store; implemented missing-value handling, outlier winsorisation, bucketing, and time-based train/validation splits to avoid data leakage."
      - "Trained and compared logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forests for default-probability (PD) prediction; the final stacked model reached about 0.89 ROC-AUC and KS≈0.45 on the held-out validation set."
      - "Used calibration curves and score-band statistics to design a three-way decision rule — approve / reject / manual review for highly uncertain cases — so that the overall approval rate stayed roughly unchanged while capturing >95% of customers who later became 30-day-past-due, and reducing manual review volume by around 30% compared with the previous rule-based system."
