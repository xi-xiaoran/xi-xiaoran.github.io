    teaser: "A bi-level meta-policy framework that dynamically optimizes KL regularization and learnable Dirichlet priors for robust uncertainty calibration."
    abstract: |
      Traditional evidential deep learning methods rely on static hyperparameters for uncertainty calibration,
      limiting adaptability under dynamic training states and shifting data distributions.
      We propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient
      and class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths through bi-level optimization.
      In the inner loop, model parameters are updated with a dynamically configured loss function.
      In the outer loop, a policy network learns to balance multi-objective rewards that consider both predictive accuracy
      and uncertainty quality.
      Unlike fixed uniform priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior flexibly adapts to class distributions and training dynamics.
      Experiments show improved reliability and calibration across classification, medical segmentation, and OOD detection tasks.

    teaser: "A progressive uncertainty-guided attention framework that strengthens boundary awareness and preserves semantic evidence for reliable medical segmentation."
    abstract: |
      Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims to deliver accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making.
      Most existing methods adopt the evidential deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and theoretical robustness.
      However, EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation.
      To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty-guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on hard regions.
      PEUA progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank learning to denoise attention weights.
      We further introduce a semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy that retains critical semantics through a semantic-smooth evidence generator and fidelity-enhancing regularization.
      By embedding PEUA and SAEL into the state-of-the-art U-KAN, we propose Evidential U-KAN for trustworthy medical image segmentation.
      Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over competing methods.
