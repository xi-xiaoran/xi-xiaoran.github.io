    keywords: ["Python", "Automation", "Web Interaction"]
    teaser: "An automation toolkit designed to improve the success rate of convention ticket purchasing under heavy competition."
    details: |
      Built for real-world ticketing bottlenecks such as queue congestion and rapid sell-out scenarios.
      Designed with practical usability in mind for anime convention communities.
      (You can add technical highlights here later: browser automation stack, anti-bot strategy handling, etc.)

    keywords: ["Reinforcement Learning", "Meta-Learning", "Calibration", "EDL"]
    teaser: "A bi-level meta-policy system that learns dynamic uncertainty calibration strategies for evidential models."
    details: |
      Uses a policy network to optimize KL coefficients and class-wise Dirichlet prior strengths.
      Aims to unify accuracy and uncertainty quality under a single adaptive optimization framework.
      Serves as the codebase accompanying the arXiv/CVPR under-review manuscript.
